      <h1>To My Irene❤️,</h1>
      <p>I just wanted to take a moment to apologize if I’ve seemed stressed or short with you at times. Life can get a little crazy, and I know I don’t always handle it as calmly as I should. I never want my mood to affect you or make you feel anything but loved and appreciated. You mean the world to me, and I’m so grateful for your patience, care, and understanding.</p>
      <p>I’m working on being more mindful and keeping my cool because you deserve the best version of me. I hope you know how much you’re valued, even in moments where I might not express it the way I should. Thanks for always being there for me, and I promise to keep showing you how much you mean to me every single day.</p>
      <p>You’ve always stood by my side, even when I haven’t been my best, and that means the world to me. I promise to keep working on myself and show you the best version of me because you deserve nothing less. Thank you for being the incredible person you are. I love you more than words can say.</p>
      <p>Forever and always,</p>
      <p>-Harold</p>
